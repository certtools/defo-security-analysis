problems with ZF: mention them in report

CDNs don't operate ECH
business model -> shared mode

no business model for split mode!

statistical analysis and traffic pattern -> further research
lot of research with fingerprinting -> could work with ECH too

which medium size hoster could benefit from ECH?
what are the incentives?
only a customer requesting it? won't happen

timing issue FF: no new information

what about non HTTPS, like video conferencing?
SMTPS: ECH not that important as HTTPS

TOR: Summarize the upstream discussion

south korea: ESNI blocking, censoring pornography

browsers are permissive
if dns is misconfigured, browser tries without ECH

explore how FF and other browsers behave with famility safety software exactly, so far not tested
