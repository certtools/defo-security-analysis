# Scope

This report mainly focuses on 
* problems with deploying ECH and how to adress these,
* sources of misconfigurations
* implications of deploying ECH (assessing subsequent risks)
* attacks against ECH enabled servers
* possibilities for censorship or denial of service
* the interface layers between protocols which play together to make ECH possible

# None-scope

The report does *NOT* try 
* to analyse if the used cryptographic libraries, primitives or algorithms are safe (or quantum resistant)
* to prove the security of individual implementations (or the lack of, by breaking or analysing concrete implementations)
