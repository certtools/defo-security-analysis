## Browsers

### Firefox
The Interop report mentions that ECH is disabled deliberatly when local interception software is detected, and also with ISP- or state-level censorship

### TOR Project

ECH currently not supported, as the Firefox base requires DoH for ECH and TOR disables DoH for privacy reasons.

- Reasoning why DoH is not used: https://lists.torproject.org/mailman3/hyperkitty/list/tor-dev@lists.torproject.org/thread/6GDO7CYEFIKID7QQCRVYVFNIVETWWWWY/#6ZBFGNSRPWRCEO7PVPSHHVLAOGF7KN3C
